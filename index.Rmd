You know that great paper you just wrote, you were done with it, so you called it “final”. And then, you sent it to your advisor for her last comments. So you renamed it “final_thisone”. A few days passed, and you realized there was a typo in your figure, and you renamed it “final_thisone_really”. A couple of weeks pass, you get comments back from the reviewer, you start changing it and you renamed your file “final_submitted”. And then… your advisor think you should rewrite the conclusion and the file become “final_submitted_really”.

A year pass, you are mentoring a new undergrad in the lab, and she asks you for your final document so she can look at your methods… You open your folder, and mesmerized by the number of final labelled final, you forget which one if the correct one. Sounds familiar?

+ Most often you will interface with GitHub with the command line, GitHub Desktop App, or RStudio.

# Remote

.pull-left[
+ You should always back up your work, ideally somewhere different than your local drive. In __Git__, this place is called the __remote repository__

]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/git-areas.png')
```
]
---

# The Working Tree

+ This is the area where you are currently working. 

--
+ Also known as the “__untracked__” area of git. 

--
+ Here if you make changes and do not explicitly save them to git, you will lose the changes made to your files. 

--
+ This loss of changes occurs because git is not aware of the files or changes in the __Working Tree__ until you tell it to pay attention to them.

--
+ If you make changes to files in your working tree git will recognize that they are modified, but until you tell git “Hey pay attention to these files,” it won’t save anything that goes on in them.
---

# Staging Area

+ The Staging Area is when git starts tracking and saving changes that occur in files. 
+ You tell git that I want to track these specific files, then git says okay and moves them from you Working Tree to the Staging Area and says “Cool, I know about this file in its entirety.” 
+ However, if you make any more additional changes after adding a file to the Staging Area, git will not know about those specific changes until you tell it to see them. You explicitly have to tell git to notice the edits in your files.

> When we stage a particular file we say we're __adding__ it to the __staging area__ because the command to do so is `git add 'filename'`

---

# Local Repository

+ The area that saves everything 

--
+ That's it...

--
+ We can add our staged changes to the __local repository__ by __committing__ them. 
---

# Commits

+ When you want to take a snapshot of a file or files, you create a **commit**

--
+ A commit is equivalent to saving a version of a file(s)

--
+ Git allows you to **tell the story of your project** by tracking changes through commit messages.

--
+ Every time you make a commit, you are leaving a breadcrumb of those files to come back to

# Integrating Git/GitHub with R

# Happy Git with R

+ You can choose from several options when using Git/GitHub:

--
  + Command-line (Terminal)
  
--
  + GitHub Desktop App (Available from the Software Center)
  
--
  + RStudio
--

+ Since I do most of my work in `R`, I'd rather not have to open a new program just to use Git.

--
+ You can use:
  + The RStudio git pane for a point and click
--

  + Packages to facilate git workflows. I highly recommend __{`gert`}__ and __{`usethis`}__

## Contributing to someone else's projects

####Since our pull request had a missing word, the project owner leaves us some comments requesting changes. 

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, out.height = '500px', out.width='800px'}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/pr-review.png')
```

## Contributing to someone else's projects

#### We can then go back and complete the sentence, commit the correction, and push them back with __`usethis::pr_push()`__

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/pr-response.png')
```

## Contributing to someone else's projects

+ Now the reviewer gets another chance to review our changes. 
+ At this point they might choose to just make the necessary changes and push their commits into our pull request to finish things up.

--
+ The reviewer can fetch the pull request to their local machine 
```{r}
usethis::pr_fetch()
```

--

+ Fetching the PR creates a local branch for them called _`malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme`_ 
--

+ Once the reviewer makes the necessary changes they run __`pr_push()`__ to push their changes into our PR
--

+ Finally, the reviewer merges our pull request on GitHub by running __`pr_finish()`__

```{r}
#> ✔ Checking that remote branch 'malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme' has the changes in 'local/malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme'
#> ✔ Switching back to 'master' branch
#> ✔ Pulling changes from GitHub source repo 'origin/master'
#> ✔ Deleting local 'malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme' branch
#> ✔ Removing remote 'mine-cetinkaya-rundel'
```

---

+ Since the reviewer has contributed some code to our pull request, we can get that code back to our computer with __`usethis::pr_pull()`__
--

+ This feature can be useful in PRs if there are a few rounds of alternating contributions from you and the maintainer
--

+ In this case it is optional, since the full PR has already been incorporated into the default branch of the source repo.
