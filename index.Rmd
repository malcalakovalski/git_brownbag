You know that great paper you just wrote, you were done with it, so you called it “final”. And then, you sent it to your advisor for her last comments. So you renamed it “final_thisone”. A few days passed, and you realized there was a typo in your figure, and you renamed it “final_thisone_really”. A couple of weeks pass, you get comments back from the reviewer, you start changing it and you renamed your file “final_submitted”. And then… your advisor think you should rewrite the conclusion and the file become “final_submitted_really”.

A year pass, you are mentoring a new undergrad in the lab, and she asks you for your final document so she can look at your methods… You open your folder, and mesmerized by the number of final labelled final, you forget which one if the correct one. Sounds familiar?

#So what is Git? 



.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Git is a __version control system__. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a __repository__ or repo – in a sane, highly structured way. 

It is like the “Track Changes” feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.

+ __Git__ is the software you will use __locally__ to record changes to a set of files.

+ __GitHub__ is a __hosting service__ that provides a Git-aware home for such projects on the internet. 
+ __GitHub__ is like DropBox or Google Drive, but more structured, powerful, and programmatic.

# Let's Git Started: Key Concepts


---

# Repository (Repo)

+ This is where all your project files live

--
+ You can use __Git__ to take snapshots (version control) of all the files in a folder

--
+ With __GitHub__ your repo con live on your computer and on the web

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/create-repo.png')
```
]
---

# Remote

.pull-left[
+ You should always back up your work, ideally somewhere different than your local drive. In __Git__, this place is called the __remote repository__
+ __GitHub__ is just a very popular __remote__
+ Some alternative remotes are:
  + [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
  + [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)

# Cloning

---
# Git Areas
.pull-left[
+ Once we start making changes to the __repo__ we __cloned__, these changes will exist in one of the three core __areas__ to Git: 
  + __Working Tree__ (a.k.a untracked area)
  + __Staging Area__ 
  + __Local Repository__
+ Files and modifications will travel from the __Working Tree__ to the __Staging Area__ and finish at the __Local Repository__. 
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/git-areas.png')
```
]
---

# The Working Tree 

+ This is the area where you are currently working. 
--

+ If you make changes to files in your __working tree__ Git will recognize that they are modified, but won't save anything that goes on in them
  + This is why some people call it the “__untracked__” area of git. 
--

+ Git will only start __tracking__ our files once we explicitly tell it to.
--



.pull-left[
You can check where your files are with:
```{r}
gert::git_status()
```
]

.pull-right[
<br>
```{r, echo=F, eval=T}

```

]

---

# Staging Area

The __Staging Area__ is where Git starts tracking and saving changes that occur in files. 

--
+ You tell __Git__ you want to track these specific files

--
+ __Git__ moves them from your __Working Tree__ to the __Staging Area__ and says “Cool, I know about this file in its entirety.” 

--
> When we stage a particular file we say we're __adding__ it to the __staging area__ because the terminal command staging is `git add 'filename'`

---

# Local Repository

+ The area that saves everything 

--
  + That's it...

--
+ Now we're ready to add our __staged changes__ to the __local repository__ by __committing__ them. 
---

# Who's Scared of Commitment?

+ When you want to take a snapshot of a file, you create a **commit**

--
+ A __commit__ is equivalent to saving a version of a file(s)

--
+ Every time you make a commit you must also write a short commit message. Ideally, this conveys the motivation for the change

--
+ Commiting frequently will save you lots of headaches

--

--
  + GitHub Desktop App (Available from the Software Center)
  
--
  + RStudio
--

+ Once the reviewer makes the necessary changes they run __`pr_push()`__ to push their changes into our PR

--
+ Finally, the reviewer merges our pull request on GitHub by running __`pr_finish()`__

```{r}
#> ✔ Checking that remote branch 'malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme' has the changes in 'local/malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme'
#> ✔ Switching back to 'master' branch
#> ✔ Pulling changes from GitHub source repo 'origin/master'
#> ✔ Deleting local 'malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme' branch
#> ✔ Removing remote 'mine-cetinkaya-rundel'

# Pulling Reviewer Changes

+ Since the reviewer has contributed some code to our pull request, we can get that code back to our computer with __`usethis::pr_pull()`__
--

+ This feature can be useful in PRs if there are a few rounds of alternating contributions from you and the maintainer
--

+ In this case it is optional, since the full PR has already been incorporated into the default branch of the source repo.
