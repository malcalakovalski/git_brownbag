You know that great paper you just wrote, you were done with it, so you called it “final”. And then, you sent it to your advisor for her last comments. So you renamed it “final_thisone”. A few days passed, and you realized there was a typo in your figure, and you renamed it “final_thisone_really”. A couple of weeks pass, you get comments back from the reviewer, you start changing it and you renamed your file “final_submitted”. And then… your advisor think you should rewrite the conclusion and the file become “final_submitted_really”.

A year pass, you are mentoring a new undergrad in the lab, and she asks you for your final document so she can look at your methods… You open your folder, and mesmerized by the number of final labelled final, you forget which one if the correct one. Sounds familiar?

# Then Git &amp; GitHub are for you

#### .large[__Git__ and __GitHub__ allow for easy management and sharing of data analytic content]

#So what is Git? 



.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Git is a __version control system__. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a __repository__ or repo – in a sane, highly structured way. 

It is like the “Track Changes” feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.

+ __Git__ is the software you will use __locally__ to record changes to a set of files. 
+ When you use __GitHub__, __Git__ is always doing its things behind the scenes

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="imgs/github-logo.png" height="200px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
+ __GitHub__ is a __hosting service__ that provides a Git-aware home for such projects on the internet. 
+ __GitHub__ is like DropBox or Google Drive, but more structured, powerful, and programmatic.

# Let's Git Started: Key Concepts


---

# Repository (Repo)

+ This is where all your project files live

--
+ You can use __Git__ to take snapshots (version control) of all the files in a folder

--
+ With __GitHub__ your repo con live on your computer and on the web

&lt;img src="imgs/git-brownbag-repo.png" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Repository (Repo)
.pull-left[
+ It's really easy to create one from GitHub 
+ Clicking on _your repositories &gt; New_ will take you to a screen with some options for how to initialize your repository 
]

--
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="imgs/create-repo.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---

# Remote

.pull-left[
+ You should always back up your work, ideally somewhere different than your local drive. In __Git__, this place is called the __remote repository__
+ __GitHub__ is just a very popular __remote__
+ Some alternative remotes are:
  + [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
  + [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="imgs/remotes.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Cloning

.left-column[To get some work from a __remote__ for the first time you need to __clone__ it!.

This is a fancy term for downloading a local copy of the repo]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="imgs/cloning.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


---
# Git Areas
.pull-left[
+ Once we start making changes to the __repo__ we __cloned__, these changes will exist in one of the three core __areas__ to Git: 
  + __Working Tree__ (a.k.a untracked area)
  + __Staging Area__ 
  + __Local Repository__
+ Files and modifications will travel from the __Working Tree__ to the __Staging Area__ and finish at the __Local Repository__. 
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="imgs/git-areas.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---

# The Working Tree 

+ This is the area where you are currently working. 
--

+ If you make changes to files in your __working tree__ Git will recognize that they are modified, but won't save anything that goes on in them
  + This is why some people call it the “__untracked__” area of git. 
--

+ Git will only start __tracking__ our files once we explicitly tell it to.
--

You can check where your files are with:

```r

# Staging Area

The __Staging Area__ is where Git starts tracking and saving changes that occur in files. 

--
+ You tell __Git__ you want to track these specific files

--
+ __Git__ moves them from your __Working Tree__ to the __Staging Area__ and says “Cool, I know about this file in its entirety.” 

--
&gt; When we stage a particular file we say we're __adding__ it to the __staging area__ because the terminal command staging is `git add 'filename'`

---

# Local Repository

+ The area that saves everything 

--
  + That's it...

--
+ Now we're ready to add our __staged changes__ to the __local repository__ by __committing__ them. 
---

# Who's Scared of Commitment?

+ When you want to take a snapshot of a file, you create a **commit**

--
+ A __commit__ is equivalent to saving a version of a file(s)

--
+ Every time you make a commit you must also write a short commit message. Ideally, this conveys the motivation for the change

--
+ Commiting frequently will save you lots of headaches

# What are our options?

+ You can choose from several options when using Git/GitHub:

--
  + Command-line (Terminal)
  
--
  + GitHub Desktop App (Available from the Software Center)
  
--
  + RStudio
--

+ Since I do most of my work in `R`, I'd rather not have to open a new program just to use Git.

--
+ You can use:
  + The RStudio git pane for a point and click
--

  + Packages to facilate git workflows. I highly recommend __{`gert`}__ and __{`usethis`}__

# Usual Git Workflow for Collaboration

+ If we had ownership over the repository, we could __push__ our changes to our collaborators with __`gert::git_push()`__
--

+ In turn, they would be able __fetch__ and then __pull__ our changes with __`gert::git_fetch()`__ and __`gert::git_pull()`__

--
+ Since we are not direct collaborators to the project, our workflow will be a little different.

# Sending Over Our Suggestion 

.pull-left[
+ __Push__ the local change to our copy of _example-repo_ on GitHub using __`usethis::pr_push()`__
]

.pull-right[


```r
usethis::pr_push()
✓ Setting active project to '/Users/malcalakovalski/Documents/Projects/example-repo'
✓ Pushing local 'feature-improve-readme' branch to 'origin' remote.
• Create PR at link given below
✓ Opening URL 'https://github.com/malcalakovalski/example-repo/compare/feature-improve-readme'
```
This launches a browser window at the specified URL and we need to click on where it says __"Create Pull Request"__

# Sending Over Our Suggestion

.pull-left[
+ __Push__ the local change to our copy of _example-repo_ on GitHub using __`usethis::pr_push()`__
+ GitHub will ping the project owner and they will review our pull request. We can view this pull request in the browser with `usethis::pr_view()`

### If our _pull request_ is perfect, the maintainer will accept it (i.e. _merge_ it).

### ⚠️ Alas, there was an omission in our commit: 
### Instead of writing _"pull request"_ we wrote _"pull" _

### 🚨🚨🚨 Since our pull request had a missing word, the project owner leaves us some comments requesting changes.

## Responding to our PR Review

We can then go back and complete the sentence, commit the correction, and push them back with __`usethis::pr_push()`__

## Reviewing a Pull Request

+ Now the reviewer gets another chance to review our changes. 
+ At this point they might choose to just make the necessary changes themselves and push their commits into our pull request to finish things up.

--
+ The reviewer can fetch the pull request to their local machine with __`usethis::pr_fetch()`__

--
+ Fetching the PR creates a local branch for them called _`malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme`_ 

--
+ Once the reviewer makes the necessary changes they run __`pr_push()`__ to push their changes into our PR

--
+ Finally, the reviewer merges our pull request on GitHub by running __`pr_finish()`__


```r
#&gt; ✔ Checking that remote branch 'malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme' has the changes in 'local/malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme'
#&gt; ✔ Switching back to 'master' branch
#&gt; ✔ Pulling changes from GitHub source repo 'origin/master'
#&gt; ✔ Deleting local 'malcalakovalski-feature-improve-readme' branch
#&gt; ✔ Removing remote 'mine-cetinkaya-rundel'
```

# Pulling Reviewer Changes

+ Since the reviewer has contributed some code to our pull request, we can get that code back to our computer with __`usethis::pr_pull()`__
--

+ This feature can be useful in PRs if there are a few rounds of alternating contributions from you and the maintainer
--

+ In this case it is optional, since the full PR has already been incorporated into the default branch of the source repo.

# Shameless Plug: Help me help you

+ If you use __`{ggbrookings}`__ and are having trouble, please submit an __issue__ on GitHub
+ Posting an issue gives me an opportunity to respond to your questions in a public forum that others can benefit from too!
+ Even better, if you have a suggestion for a new feature or an improvement to the package please submit a __pull request__!
